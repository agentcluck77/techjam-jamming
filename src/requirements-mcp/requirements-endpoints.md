## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1 (Critical for Lawyer Agent)**:
1. =ï¿½ **Document Upload & Processing** (needed for Workflow 3)
2. =ï¿½ **Metadata-Based Search** (search within specific document)
3.  **Basic Document Search** (should be straightforward)

### **Phase 2 (Performance)**:
4. **Bulk Retrieval** (for Workflow 1 - compliance checking)
5. **Document Management** (for UI integration)
6. **Health Check** (for monitoring)

---

## Technical Notes

### PDF Processing
- Extract text from PDF documents
- Create chunks with proper metadata (document_id, page, section)
- Store in ChromaDB with document-specific filtering capability

### Metadata Filtering
- ChromaDB queries must support filtering by `document_id`
- Enable searching within specific documents only
- Support bulk operations across all documents

### Requirements Extraction
- Parse chunks to identify structured requirements
- Extract requirement type (functional, compliance, operational)
- Identify priority levels and responsible teams

### Error Handling
- Handle PDF parsing failures gracefully
- Return meaningful error messages for upload failures
- Support partial results if some documents fail to process

### Performance Targets
- **PDF Upload**: < 10 seconds for documents <50 pages
- **Search**: < 2 seconds response time
- **Bulk Retrieval**: < 5 seconds for 100+ requirements
- **Metadata Search**: < 3 seconds per document

## ðŸ”— Integration with Lawyer Agent

**LLM Workflows** (via Standard MCP):
- Search for relevant requirements documents (semantic search)
- Search within specific uploaded documents (metadata search)
- Retrieve all requirements for compliance checking (bulk retrieve)

**Code Workflows** (via HTTP REST):
- Document upload and processing
- Document management and listing
- System health monitoring

### Lawyer Agent Usage Patterns:

1. **Workflow 1** (Legal Doc â†’ Requirements Compliance):
   - LLM: `search_requirements(search_type="bulk_retrieve")` to get ALL requirements
   - Check each requirement against new legal document

2. **Workflow 3** (Requirements Doc â†’ Legal Compliance):
   - Code: `POST /api/v1/upload` to process new PDF (steps 1-2)
   - LLM: `search_requirements(search_type="metadata", document_id="...")` to extract requirements (steps 3-6)
   - Legal compliance analysis for extracted requirements

3. **General Usage**:
   - LLM: `search_requirements(search_type="semantic", query="...")` for finding relevant requirements during analysis

## Workflow 3 Integration Details

**Your Scope (Steps 1-2)**:
1. User uploads PDF ï¿½ `POST /api/v1/upload`
2. Requirements MCP processes and stores with metadata

**Lawyer Agent Scope (Steps 3-6)**:
3. Lawyer agent calls `POST /api/v1/search_by_metadata` with new document_id
4. Extract requirements from new document
5. For each extracted requirement ï¿½ search Legal MCP for applicable regulations
6. Generate compliance status with human-in-the-loop

**Key Integration Point**: `document_id` handoff between your processing and lawyer agent analysis
